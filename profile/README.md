We are a group of ambitious Colgate University students from diverse backgrounds, united by a vision to make the college application process less stressful and more accessible. 
Our mission is to empower students, particularly those from underrepresented groups worldwide, by providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their college choices. 
At the same time, we aim to assist institutions in creating environments that reflect diversity in culture, geography, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

As proud first-generation students at Colgate, we are committed to advancing the university's vision of a diverse and inclusive campus.
